# Number-guessing-game

This is a simple command-line number guessing game implemented in Python. The program randomly selects a number within a user-defined range, and the player tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## **How to Play**

1. The game prompts you to enter a maximum range.
2. After setting the range, the program randomly picks a number between 0 and the maximum range.
3. You need to guess the number.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. The game ends when you guess the correct number, and the total number of guesses is displayed.
